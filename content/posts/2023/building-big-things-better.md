title: Building Big Things Better

Over the last 2 years I have had the privilege of working on some of the largest tunneling projects in North America. Most recently, two of the first single-bore transit tunnels to be built here: Toronto's Scarborough Subway Extension (technically, I have been working on the stations, not the tunnel) and San Francisco's Silicon Valley Extension.

Involvement in these megaprojects has led me to two questions:
- Is this worth it?
- If so, how can we build them better?

In one of my more recent pursuits of these questions, I have read two works that have really helped me to understand it a little better (though still leading to more questions than answers):

[How Big Things Get Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61327449-how-big-things-get-done) : a book by a by an economic geographer named Bent Flyvbjerg (according to his [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Flyvbjerg)) and professional planner. He looks back over 30 years of working on megaprojects, and a database he has compiled of over 1,600 projects, to try and understand what causes the successes and failures.

[TransitCost.com's executive summary](https://transitcosts.com/executive_summary/) : an executive summary of a more exhaustive report produced by a NY University research group that looks at the differences in high and low cost transit construction. They compare costs of transit projects in countries across the globe and try to summarize the reasons some nations built for much less money than others.

## High wages does not mean expensive construction

Sweden has the highest wages of the countries studied, but is in the low-cost group. High-cost countries tend to overstaff their projects with both blue-collar and white collar jobs. The Transit Cost study found 40%-60% over-staffing in Boston and New York projects. I understand that NY and Boston are unique labor markets relative to most of the US, but from personal experience I could easily be convinced other projects are at least 30% overstaffed.

## Modularized projects succeed at high rates

Flyvbjerg found that solar power projects had mean cost overruns of 1% and only 2% of projects had cost overruns in excess of 50% of the baseline budget. This can be compared to tunnel projects at 37% and 28% respectively. There are several reasons for this, but his main justification is solar projects' ability to modularize. Every part of these projects can be systematized in straight-forward ways: solar cells are assembled into solar arrays at one factor, another factory can make partially assembled mounting frames and hardware. Once everything is at the site, the Lego pieces can be assembled on a nice graded site with no overhead obstructions and foundations that are some form of small to medium diameter drilled or driven pile.

This is very different to most underground projects, only so much can be modularized in such a straight-forward manner. But, just because something is difficult does not mean it is not worth the effort. We could almost certain do more design standardization (according to Flyvbjerg, in the 90's Madrid built 37 stations based on one modular design) so that procurement and learning curves can benefit from scale. Other ways to modularize would be some version of the the Boring Company approach of [_any tunnel diameter you want, as long as it's 12 feet_](https://www.boringcompany.com/products), though we might a few addition diameter options.

## Using unit rate contracts make (inevitable) changes less litigious

This one might have been the most interesting lesson to me. In low cost countries, the Transit Cost report finds that contracts are frequently unit price (they use the term "itemized") and the prices are publicly available. In North America, typically little more than wage rates are public knowledge. Set rates allow for much quicker change orders: when a changed condition occurs, all the parties have to do is count up quantities since the rates are already set. In this way, change orders happen

## There are always more questions

The three lessons above are just the tip of this ice-breaker. If both texts are even partially correct, there are some pretty significant changes that would need to happen in our industry to make real progress. And those changes are based on data from either other industries, other countries, or both.

These projects we work on are so large that no one person can understand their entire scope (though many times we feel it's just all _those_ people that don't get it, _I know exactly what is going on_). And we simply will never find fully satisfying solutions to these problems. But in the words of Deng Xiaoping, we are "crossing the river by feeling the stones". We can only know for sure what is right in front of us, the rest we have to figure out by iterating. Those iterations will be expensive, but not as expensive as waiting to cross.
