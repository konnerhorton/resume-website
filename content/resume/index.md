We were desginers on the progressive design build team under contract to deliver the stations and egress buildings. We were focused on the geotechnical conditions and support of excavation design.

-   Extracted, parsed, and migrated geotechnical data from pdfs and unstructured excel sheets into a geotechnical database.
-   Managed QC for over 35,000 geotechnical data records.
-   Performed statistical analysis to determine geotechnical parameters.
-   Developed design documents for support of excavation and dewatering design.

November 2023 - Present

Six miles of transit rail including five miles of single-bore tunnel and three underground stations. We were responsible for developing the schedule and estimate as an independent check on the progressive design build team.

-   Constructed a schedule for all underground and transit station work.

### Potomac River Tunnel

_Project Engineer with Aldea Services, Inc. (offsite), Washington, District of Columbia, USA_

July 2022 - February 2023

Five and a half miles of 18-foot ID CSO tunnel with multiple drop shafts and overflow structures. The project included two TBM's (soil and rock), multiple challenging surface constraints, and a very tight schedule. We were the lead designers on a design-build team to develop the bid and estimate for the project.

-   Built the detailed permit schedule to dove-tail into the construction schedule.
-   Managed sub-designers in design of support of excavation, SEM excavations, and maintenance of traffic.
-   Participated in Technical Colaboration Meetings with the project Owner to develop technical concepts and proprosals.

### Eagle Mountain - Woodfibre Gas Pipeline

_Project Engineer with Aldea Services, Inc. (offsite), Squamish, British Columbia, CA_

April 2022 - July 2022

Nine kilometers of tunnel (approximately half rock and half soil) constructed under an environmentally sensitive area to convey two 24-inch gas pipelines. The project includes the rock and soil tunnels intercepting at the rock / soil interface at depth. We were the lead desginer on the design-build team delivering the project.

-   Performed slope stability analyses for cut slopes at the tunnel portal.
-   Designed initial ground support for the starter tunnel (in jointed rock).
-   Developed premiliary grouting layouts (from the TBM) to stabilize the rock / soil interface at the intersection of two tunnels.

### Specialty Grouting - Various Projects

_Project Manager with Jensen's Pressure Grouting (onsite), Atlanta, Georgia, USA_

December 2020 - September 2021

Managed grouting and infrastructure repair crews for various small projects. Project value ranged from $10,000 to $370,000 with durations typically between two days and six weeks. Projects included various applications of cement & polyurethane grouting, slope stability, and structure concrete repair.

-   Doubled annual gross revenue while improving gross profit margins by five percentage points.
-   Responsible for the entire life cycle of each project (sales through to contract completion).
-   Implemented office and field communications systems and workflows that allowed us to increase crew utilization (leading to doubled revenues).

### Plane Train West Extension Tunnel & Shaft

_Project Engineer with Guy F. Atkinson Construction (onsite), Atlanta, Georgia, USA_

February 2020 - December 2020

Nine hundred feet of SEM tunnel to provide a back-of-house switch to the ATL Plane Train system. The progressive design build project included a secant pile wall shaft, blasting adjacent to sensitive structures, and extensive deformation monitoring system. We were the tunnel contractor responsible for delivering the tunnel and associated structures.

-   Managed internal engineering team to procure materials, deliver pre-construction workplans, and develope crew schedules.
-   Managed development and installation of groundwater monitoring and surface settlement instrumentation
-   Developed shotcrete mix designs and training programs to be used for installation of ground support.
-   Assisted in developing drill & blast plans in close proximity to sensitive structures for shaft and tunnel.

### River Intake Pump Station - Connector Tunnel

_Project Engineer with Guy F. Atkinson Construction (onsite), Atlanta, Georgia, USA_

February 2020 - December 2020

Three hundred sixty feet of liner plate tunnel to install a 60-inch ductile iron pipe. The construction shaft was built within 20 feet of an existing shaft and the tunnel passed under the CSX railroad right-of-way. We were the tunneling contractor delivering the project.

-   Managed daily operations including project schedule, procurement, and submittal process.
-   Liaised with CSX railroad for an under crossing and other railroad work activities.
-   Assisted in developing thermal control plan for mass concrete placement.
-   Developed grout mix design and pipe backfill plan for grouting the pipe in place.

### Raw Water Supply Program Tunnel

_Project Engineer with Guy F. Atkinson Construction (onsite), Atlanta, Georgia, USA_

January 2019 - April 2020

Four and a half miles of rock TBM tunnel with 2,000 feet of drill-&-blast tunnels and two pump stations. The project included raised-bore, blind-bored, and conventionally mined shafts. We were the tunnel contractor delivering the underground portions of the work.

-   Managed the field engineering for the cast-in-place lining operations.
-   Coordinated work concurrent on on four projects sites.
-   Developed and executed workplans for various operations including thermal controled concrete, rock-fall drape systems, and large diameter vertical pipe installation.

### High Museum Of Art

_Project Engineer with Skanska Building USA (onsite), Atlanta, Georgia, USA_
