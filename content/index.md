## Welcome

Depending on the day, I work as a construction manager, geologist, or civil engineer in the tunnel construction industry. Some of the civil engineering world is (to me) indistinguishable from magic (like a 70 m deep slurry wall). Other parts of the work are pure drudgery (like trying to figure out the relevant information in 10 gigabytes of .pdf's). But I try to take the good with the bad in hopes that one day I'll look back on being a part of some pretty cool infrastructure projects.

When I am not at work, I am likely reading (usually either non-fiction, or science-fiction), playing BJJ at [Superfly](https://superflybjj.com/), or cooking (and eating).

## And a special thanks to
