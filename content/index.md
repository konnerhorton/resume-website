## Welcome

Depending on the day, I work as a construction manager, geologist, or civil engineer in the tunnel construction industry. Some of the civil engineer world is (to me) indistinguishable from magic (like a 70 m deep slurry wall). Other parts of the work are pure drudgery (like extracting thousands of data points from pdfs). But I try to take the good with the bad in hopes that one day I'll look back on being a part of some pretty cool infrastructure projects.

When I am not at work, I am likely reading (usually either non-fiction, or science-fiction), training brazilian jiu-jitsu at [Superfly](https://superflybjj.com/), or cooking (and eating).

## Other stuff I'm working on

-   Streamlit apps:
    -   [AGS data file viewer](https://ags-viewer.streamlit.app/)
    -   [Bouwer-Rice hydraulic conductivity calculator](https://bouwerrice.streamlit.app/)
    -   [Soil shear strength calculator (from triax tests)](https://soilshearstrength.streamlit.app/)
