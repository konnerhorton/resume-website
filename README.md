I have never enjoyed using social media but recently thought (for professional reasons) it might be nice to have my own little place on the internet. This is meant to be a place to house and display my resume, then periodically post some thoughts or samples of my work (which, as of this writing, is in civil engineering).

The site is currenlty deployed via [Digital Ocean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform).
